Even today, the recipe remains that of Vincenzo Piccirillo's grandmother, known as La Masardona, who, in the post-war period, cooked fried pizza on the street under her home to make some money. Since then, many things have changed, but the pizza remains the same. Vincenzo is, in fact, the only one in Naples who follows the technique of using a double layer of dough to contain the filling, rather than folding a single disc into a pocket shape. Not surprisingly, this small establishment is always crowded with customers patiently waiting for a fried pizza filled with lard, buffalo ricotta, provolone, pepper, and basil.", price: 10, openinghour: "9-10", address: "Via Giulio Cesare Capaccio, 27 Piazza vittoria, 5", transport: "linea 1", image: "la masardona", image2: "pompei2", category: .nightlife),
